# Election Analysis

## Overview:

#####  I was given raw data from an election and asked to create a code that would announce three things: how many votes each candidate received, what percentage of the vote each candidate received, and who won the election. I also needed the data to be pushed into a csv text file.


## Results:

##### This code will take the number of votes cast for each candidate in the separate counties and calculate how many each candidate got. It will also tell you what percentage of the vote each candidate received. It will then announce it and push the data to a csv text file.
